# Multiprocessing In Python

Calculating Fibonachi sequence siries and parallel; time comparizon!

## Roadmap

- Additional browser support

- Add more integrations

## Installation

requires python >=3.6

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MerlinEmris/multiprocessing_in_python.git
```

```bash
python multiproses3-ready.py
```

## Usage/Examples

App gets 2 variables from num to num2
Application calculates Fibonachi secuence siries as normal python app and in parallel where task is seperated between cpu cores.

```bash
python multiproses3-ready.py 12 22
```

## Running Tests

To run tests, run the following command

```bash
  python test.py
```
